# Build for Unity VR Project 'The Woods'

Made for a virtual reality course. VR experience taking place in a small, wooded area with a cabin, crossbow, and climbable area. Made most assets myself using Blender and 
texturing using Substance Painter. Used some C# for interactables and sounds.

To play you'll need a VR-HMD with controllers. The setup used to run it used SteamVR along with Windows Mixed Reality and setting SteamVR as OpenXR runtime in the SteamVR developer settings.
